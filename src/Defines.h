* Defines for gains for rate, self-levelled and heading hold modes
* Note: Gain values will depend upon model type, control surface area and servo speed & refresh times. Do not assume the gains given below will work for yur model.
* Try starting with the P, I and F values given, and use D once PIF tuned to soften bobbles or speed oscillations. 
* With the PIF gains given rotate model in all 3 axis and judge if corrections are exceesive. If in any doubt reduce P and I until you feel corrections are a good starting point, smaller is better for first flight.
* Note: Feedforward (F) does the work, PID makes up for any shortfall in F. F will need tuning to sort over/undershoot of stick motion where the model will bounce back, or continue to rotate briefly when stick is centred.
